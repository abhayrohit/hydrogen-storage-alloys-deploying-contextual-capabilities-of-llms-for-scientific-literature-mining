Ti0.5Fe0.45Mn0.05,1.68 wt%,0 to 50 °C,1 to 40 bar,"Induction furnace melting at 1300 °C under argon, cast in a rectangular copper mold.","High capacity 1.68 wt% at 25 °C; elastic modulus ~198 GPa (163–229 GPa) and Young’s modulus 269 GPa.; Elastic modulus values differ between ultrasonic, compression, and nanoindentation methods due to scale effects.; Mean indentation elastic modulus 294 ± 60 GPa; domain moduli 265–384 GPa and hardness 9.2–25.4 GPa.",Mn addition reduces defects and improves kinetics.; Samples with internal cracks were excluded from mechanical testing.; Elastic modulus average 198 GPa; heterogeneity observed microscopically.; Heterogeneous microstructure; pre‑existing cracks reduce macroscopic stiffness.
